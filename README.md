# Snail Pic of the Day

## About

I think snails are cute and this is a passion project to help display the collection of snail pictures that I've taken over the years. Plus, I wanted to learn how to use REST APIs, so this was a good opportunity to do so. <br/> <br/>

**Links** <br/>
The [REST API](https://github.com/EnterOrion/snail-pic-api) <br/>
Where I can create new snail pics: [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/EnterOrion/snail-pic-admin)

## Tools (Frontend)

- Vite
- React
- React-router (client-side routing)
- React-paginate (break content into chunks/pages)
- date-fns (format the date on the cards)
- SASS
